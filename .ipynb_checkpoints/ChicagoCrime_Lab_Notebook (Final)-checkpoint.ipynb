    "So, the thought here is similar to the \"fewer crimes during bad weather\" hypothesis. People are usually hanging out with their family on Xmas and Thanksgiving, for example, and are less likely to be breaking into houses. Initially, I just plotted the holidays against the average crime per day and it did show a decrease. However, Scott brought up a great question: how do we know that these days don't just have fewer crimes since they're generally in the colder months (temperature being a confounding variable). To address that question, I compared the holiday arrest average against the average number of arrests in the surrounding days see if the decrease was still there. It was!"
